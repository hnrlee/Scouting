# Scoutr

A basic potentially functional program for FRC Scouting (Specifically FIRST Stronghold [2016]).

## What is scouting?

In FRC, scouting is an important part of competition strategy. By scouting, teams collect information on other teams that they may be allied with or playing against during the course of the competition. By doing so, these teams are able to develop strategies to either work with or effectively combat their opponents.

## What information is collected via scouting?

In general, useful information about a team such as their drive characteristics, abilities, strategies, and driver experience are collected in person. However, statistics are also an incredibly useful tool in designing a strategy. This program allows for users to log data on teams in person on a laptop or other computer along with obtaining and downloading statistics and data on these teams from the internet. By combining these sets of data, strategizing becomes much more effective.

## What this program does

This program downloads data from the FIRST and The Blue Alliance servers via their respective APIs. Each match from every previous competition is downloaded and information from each match is picked apart and assigned to each team. By doing this, we essentially find complete statistics for each team throughout the current season. This information is then statistically analyzed and graphed so as to provide useful information to whoever is coming up with a strategy.
